Hey Dan! Here is the quick info to get our project running

Set IP for server in resource/cfg-remote.txt
Set IP for Unity Client in gproClientManager.cs line 21

REIMPORT THE DLL!!!! DO A FULL REBUILD PLEASE!

The game has a 2 person limit. After you have hit capacity you must restart the server to then reconnect.
The server does need to run before clients connect
